## Dev Community Clone

### How do I get an idea to clone dev.to 🤔

At first, I intended to make a **simple comment section** to practice **[react](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**. But while searching some inspirations on google, I found dev.to and I decided to clone it.
